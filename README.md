### SICP with Racket

My attempt on doing some of the exercises of the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
This book is a truly gem and it's available for free (online and PDF).

#### Installing Racket
You'll need racket and the sicp package to get a Scheme subset, I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS:

>_sudo apt install racket_ && _raco pkg install sicp_

After the installation you can add the following line to the beginning of each .rkt file in order to select the Scheme subset:
_#lang sicp_

To run the samples:
>_racket 1.2.rkt_
